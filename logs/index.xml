      <description>A Galactic Algorithms How do we analyze an algorithm  Implement a correct and good code of the algorithm. Select the cost model for the algorithm, e.g, comparisons or other costs.  The cost model should be independent from the implementation. Decide the input model, e.g, randomness and other properties.  Build mathematics models of the algorithms [The hard part].  Break down the operations in the algorithm. Formulate a mathematical problem.</description>

      <description>A note of Week 1 from C++ for C programmers
 C++ A good old example  Multi-paradigmatic. A really upside: the shift from ordinary imperative programming to encapsulation-based on the object-oriented paradigm.  C example code:
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;time.h&amp;gt; #define SIDES 6 #define R_SIDES (rand() % SIDES + 1) int main() { int ntrails; int d1, d2; int i, j; srand(clock()); int outcomes[10000] = {0}; printf(&amp;quot;Number of trials:&amp;quot;); scanf(&amp;quot;%d&amp;quot;, &amp;amp;ntrails); for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; ntrails; ++i) { outcomes[(d1 = R_SIDE) + (d2 = R_SIDE)]++; } printf(&amp;quot;probability \n&amp;quot;); for (j = 2; j &amp;lt; ntrials * SIDES+1; ++j) { printf(&amp;quot;j = %d p = %lf\n&amp;quot;, j, (double)(outcomes[j]/trails)); } return 0; }  To C++ example</description>

      <description>Estimating object&amp;rsquo;s area by multiple images My main idea is to use essential matrix or maybe fundamental matrix to find the relationship between the image coordinate and the real world coordinate. There are two main problems which makes me struggle alot:
 How is the essential matrix if two cameras are diffent? Specicially, if two cameras have two distinct focal lengths and distortions, how we can formulate the relationship matrix between them?</description>

      <description>Crytographic Hash Function A mathematic function:
 Input: any string Output: fixed-size output (usually 256 bits) Efficiently computable  Properties: Collision-free It is very difficult to find $x$ and $y$ for a crytographic hash function such that:
$ x\neq y {\text and} H(x)= H(y)$  What is a quantitative measures for difficult level to find a collision?
One method: try $2^130$ randomly chosen inputs, we can got 99.8% chance of collision.</description>

      <description>End2End SH-BDNN to submit to TIP
Logs
 11/09/17  I think we should change the dataset, it seems that SUN397 could not be applied for the algorithms.
Bit of index 0th is always 1.
The result is quite promising. Hope that it can outperform ITQ-CCA.
 12/09/17  The result is very good. It is comparable with the Augmented Lagrangian(AL) method. I guest that the end2end version can outperform the ECCV paper.</description>

The fist impression is that the book quality is very good. I like the color of papers.

      <description>In my opinion, this is the most accessible book from Don Knuth. However, some chapters are still heavy on mathematical stuff, i.e., Chapter 2 - even though it is very interesting and covers many aspects of algorithms and data structures).
Chapter 0 There are many interesting quotes in the chapter. Some of them are worth to mention: &amp;gt; Computer science answers the question &amp;ldquo;What can be automated?&amp;rdquo;
Some principal subfields come from the early era of computer science: - The analysis of algorithms: What Knuth do.</description>

      <description>Sun397 Parameters Notes  Never touch the dimension reduction layer. Maximum 2 code instances can run at a time. lambda5 is quite crucial. If we increase, i.e. 10, the network suffers overfitting. On the other hand, the accuracy decreases if we use a smaller value. lambda2=5e-4 seems to be a good parameter. There is no different between 5e-4 and 5e-6 , do need to decrease the value. Increasing lambda2 leads to poor mAP?</description>

      <description>The repertoire method is an approach to find a closed-form for recurrence relations and sum of series. The method is introduced in Chapter 1 of ConMath but most readers at the first time struggled with it. Through the book, especially in Chapter 1 and 2, the repertoire method demonstrates its ability to solve many sums and recurrences. However, I honestly admit that it is quite difficult to apply and do not fully understand how it works.</description>

      <description>3 Papers Rejected I did not even think that the hashing paper would get rejected. It was a good paper with good motivations and well-written. ANW, Toan and Professor decided to submit the paper to the TMM journal.
I have not been mood since the morning. I do not want to do any research.</description>

      <description>Setup a new colorscheme After taking a while to find a suitable colorscheme, I finally picked jellybeans. It seems very cool compared to the previous scheme.
What next? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Now I am not having any motivations or mood to do anything. I just heard the story from Kwotsin: If I have very good networking on Linkedin, I can easily got interviews from many companies and unicorn startups.</description>

      <description>Some much pain while writing diary by English because of the lack of vocabulary. However, I have to practice using English everyday since it will help me improve writing skill.
I intent to submit the hashing paper to CVPR18. Just update new content and add more experiments. Do not know if it will work or not. Currently, I want to get more motivations in order to pursue my goals. I do not know.</description>

      <description>Do not know why I am highly motivate to write the paper right now. Basically, the introduction is quite good (in my opinion). At least, I see I do have to modify the large amount of text in the section.
The most difficult part is writing the Experiment section. Why? Because it is the weakest part in the whole paper. If the paper this time meets good reviewers, I am quite sure that it will be accepted in CVPR18.</description>

      <description>A new week for a new hope Things to do today:
 [ ] Revise the CVPR paper.
Seriously, I am quite tired of the paper. Why? It got rejected soo many times (twice?). Plus, I feel bored of doing research. Currently, I could not figure out What I have to do next.
  See. The problem is that there are so many jobs for deep learning. But I hate it.</description>

      <description>Information-theoratic lower bound of comparison-based sortings The proof uses: - Information theory: Shannon entropy. - Stirling approximation.
Still, I do not get why quantity $-n$ in which $n$ is number of elements in the array:
$$ nH - n $$
where $H$ is Shannon entropy. I suspect that it comes from the Stirling approximation. Maybe Sedgewich wants a strictly inequality?</description>

      <description>Got up at 4 am to watch the match between Federer and Alex and later I could not sleep again. Since then, I thought that if I want to get up early everyday. Just put some tasks to do early, for example, daily programming in the morning (HackerRank, leetcode, etc). I can even study English in the morning, it seems to be a good idea.
I definitely consider this plan and will try it next week.</description>

      <description>ATP Finals Fedex just lost in the semifinal against Goffin. I suspect that Fedex got injured or something. The last 2 sets is terrible. I do not think he even performed such tennis level and eventually was defeated by Goffin.
However, overall it is one of the best season of Fedex. In the match between Fedex and Raonic, when he was falling, I thought that his professional career was over.</description>

      <description>Working  ITQ results on the dataset Landmark Check Face Verification Protocol  The book &amp;ldquo;Algorithms&amp;rdquo; of Sedgewick is truly interesting. I means I could read it all day long and do not feel exhaustived. Conservely, TAoCP is difficult to follow and each day you only can read 2 or 3 pages.</description>

      <description>Wow, I waken up early today. Just keep progress and maybe I get up early and make it to be a habit.
Leetcode I am quite afraid of LeetCode, practicing programming is frustrated. Sometimes I do not feel comfortable when reading the problem description. However, I know that I have to force myself to concentrate to the practice otherwise I can not achieve what I have planned.
There is nobody can help me have full of energy in order to program day by day other than me.</description>

      <description>A terrible mistake I just found out that the MNIST dataset is configured wrongly. If the reviewers of CIASSP discover the errors, it is a huge mistake in the paper and in case if I was him, I would reject the paper. I am so disappointed at myself.</description>
