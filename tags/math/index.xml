      <description>The repertoire method is an method of finding closed-form of recurrence relations and sum of a series. The method is introduced in Chapter 1 of ConMath but most readers at the first time seem to struggle with it. Through the book, especially Chapter 1 and 2, the repertoire method demonstrates its ability to solve many sums and recurrences. However, I honestly admit that it is quite difficult to apply and fully understand how it works.</description>
