      <description>Programing Pearls - Jon Bentley
Excellent.

    Description     Title Selected Papers on Computer Science [Amazon]   Author Donald Knuth   Pages 276    This is the most accessible book from Don Knuth. Although I was published nearly 20 years ago, it still is a classic computer science book.
