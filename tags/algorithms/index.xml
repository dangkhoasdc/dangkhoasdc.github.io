      <description>Programing Pearls - Jon Bentley
Excellent.
Until now, there is no such book which makes me shout out like this after receiving from Amazon. Let brieftly review some favoriate books:
 CLRS: theoretically, this really is an &amp;ldquo;introduction&amp;rdquo; textbook about algorithms. Nonetheless, it still is an extensive reference and full of details. However, I am not impressed by the writing style and the pseudo-code.
 Algorithms, Sedgewick: one of the best textbooks ever.</description>

      <description>The programming exercise is from TAoCP, Vol3, 5.1.1-6:
 Design an algorithm that computes the inversion table $b_1, b_2 \cdots b_n$ corresponding to a given permutation $a_1a_2 \cdots a_n$ of ${1, 2, \cdots , n}$, where the running time is essentially proportional to $n\ log n$ on typical computers.
 I was really stuck on the solution Knuth given in the book. The author also mentioned another approach which actually is a modifination of merge sort.</description>
