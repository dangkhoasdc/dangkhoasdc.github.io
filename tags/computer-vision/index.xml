      <description>Transfer MAT objects from Android to NDK The main idea is to use the address of an MAT object in order to manipulate the data.
Basically, we have a function playing as a bridge between Java APIs and NDK:
public native void function_name(long matAddress); To call the function, we use Mat&amp;rsquo;s address by calling getNativeObjAddr(). All computations in NDK will affect the content of MAT in both Java and NDK layers.</description>

      <description>[It is such a long time since I wrote a dedicated technical post about computer vision.]
Introduction Since Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary research which involves different fields such as physics, biology, computer science, neuroscience, etc. For this reason, there are different approaches when people consider about the history of computer science. In this post, I summarize two viewpoints of Prof. Fei-Fei Li, and Prof. Richard Szeliski from their courses [1] and textbooks [1].</description>
