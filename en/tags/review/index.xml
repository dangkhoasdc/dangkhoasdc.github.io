      <description>After several tries, I have found out that GroupNorm works suprisingly well on detection models. Just turn on the GroupNorm of FPN and I can get an improvement with a large margin. Going further, I want to replace Batchnorm of the backbone with GroupNorm and see how I can utilize this layer in other networks.
Paper: overview and comments Criticism about BatchNorm It does not work well on models trained with small batches.</description>

      <description>Regarding the object detection problem, it seems like the community pays less attention to training pipeline than other tasks such as network design, inference improvement. This paper investigates the current problem of the CNN detection models. They consider the imbalance phenomenon, which is composed of 3 levels:
 Sample level. Feature level. Objective level.  They basically are 3 corresponding major components of a detection model: feature extraction, region proposals, and predictors.</description>
