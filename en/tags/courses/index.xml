      <description>Why model? As I understood, using models is actually to apply mathematic into different problems in a unified framework.
Intelligent Citizen of the world  Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful
 Model is the new &amp;ldquo;lingua franca&amp;rdquo;.
 Every one should know. All knowledge which human has known has models in it. It is everywhere, at any disciplines: economics (maximize payoff), biology (brain model, gene, species), political science, linguistics, law, game theory.</description>

      <description>The reasons why I want to learn this course:
 Deeply understand the material from my favorite fields such as mathematics, computer sciences, etc. Learn quickly and more effectively. Avoid procastination.  Focused and Diffuse Modes  Focused mode: concentration, when we focus on particular subjects, deeply lookinto the detail. The example from the lecture gives me a sense that this mode is the optimization methods being trapped at local region.</description>
