      <description>In this post, I will discuss two papers that try to handle the partially annotated datasets. Let talk a bit about why we care about missing annotations in detection. Firstly, labelling box is difficult. Increasing the size of taxonomy also exponentially increase the difficulty of the task. Secondly, Suppose that originally we have a training dataset with 20 categories, later, we want to add 10 more new categories into the model.</description>

      <description>Regarding the object detection problem, it seems like the community pays less attention to training pipeline than other tasks such as network design, inference improvement. This paper investigates the current problem of the CNN detection models. They consider the imbalance phenomenon, which is composed of 3 levels:
 Sample level. Feature level. Objective level.  They basically are 3 corresponding major components of a detection model: feature extraction, region proposals, and predictors.</description>
