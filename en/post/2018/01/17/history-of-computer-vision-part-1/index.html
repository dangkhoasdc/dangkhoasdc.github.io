<p>[It is such a long time since I wrote a dedicated technical post about
computer vision.]</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Since Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary research which involves different
fields such as physics, biology, computer science, neuroscience, etc. For this
reason, there are different approaches when people consider about the
history of computer science. In this post, I summarize two viewpoints of
<a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/feifeili/">Prof. Fei-Fei Li</a>, and
<a href="http://szeliski.org/Book/">Prof. Richard Szeliski</a> from their courses [<a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs131_fall1415/index.html">1</a>] and
textbooks [<a href="http://szeliski.org/Book/">1</a>]. In the early period of the research, computer vision is considered
as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. In the 1950s, the major goal of Artificial
Intelligence is to create a framework which is able to simulate the brain
mechanism of humans. As regards Computer Vision, majority research problems at that time
is also to find a system which is able to understand and manipulate visual inputs
as the human cognition system.</p>

<p>Why and how can visual systems precisely observe and interpret a scane which
is received from eyes? This question requires us study the machenism of
visual system from organisms and the development of the system throughtout
evolution. There are many prominent discoveries in many fields engaging when
scienctists were trying to find the answer.</p>

<p>This is the Big Bang of evolution since prior to this particular time, there are
few origanims existing in the planet. And suddenly, a huge number of living beings
appears on Eather. Based on archaeological evidences, there are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion#Possible_causes_of_the_.22explosion.22">several hypothesises</a> are proposed in order to explain the phenomenon. Perhaps
a meteor brought those livings, or perhaps there were tremendous changes in
weather, enviroments which transform the whole biology on the planet. [These assumptions
 are extensively discussed in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cosmos-Carl-Sagan/dp/0345331354">Cosmos, Carl Sagan</a>].</p>

<p>Biologists called the phenomenon as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion">the Cambrian explosion</a>, in a short period when most major animal appeared in the
 fossil record. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye#Rate_of_evolution">One assumption</a> to reason the phenomenon is that there emergence
 of visual system on animals. At the first time in history, organisms
 no longer were susceptible to surroundings since the visual system help them
 flexibly interact with environemnts ad well as avoid the predators. Thank to
 these systems, animals are able to <strong>survive, navigate, and manipulate</strong>. These
 activities later are considered as the most important problems in artificial
 visual system, i.e, to create a system that can <strong>survive, navigate, and manipulate</strong>

<p>Throughout history, mandkind progressively invented devices which are able to
capture a scene. There are many inventions around the world, e.g, in China,
Egyt and other ancient civilizations. However, util the 16th century, <strong>Leonardo
da Vinci</strong> is the first man who obtains rigorous records which discuss how these
devices work in detail. Later, these mystery devices are called &ldquo;cameras&rdquo;.</p>

            <h4>Ghi chép của Leonardo da Vince về mắt người.</h4>
        </figcaption>

<p>In his documents, Leonardo used the <strong>pinhole</strong> principal to model the
machenic by which a camera can capture an scene. Sometimes, it is also referred
as <strong>camera obscura</strong>. In addition, he applied this principal in order to
understand how human eyes function.
[<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leonardo-Vinci-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1501139150">This book</a> describes extensively Leonardo&rsquo;s incredible works.]</p>

<p>In this particular period, there are many inventions of the camera. Nowadays,
cameras beocme one of the most popular device around the world. As in 2016,
the number of visual sensors are more than the world population. However,
these inventions as well as Leonardo&rsquo;s discovers just end up copying the
visual environment and cameras still could not <strong>understand</strong> neither
<strong>interpret</strong> what they received.</p>

<p>In the next couple of posts, I will discuss the progress of computer vision
in the modern era, especially 1950-1970 when Artificial Intelligence was
sheer active in research community.</p>
