<p>The repertoire method is an method of finding closed-form of recurrence relations
and sum of a series. The method is introduced in Chapter 1 of ConMath but
most readers at the first time seem to struggle with it. Through the book,
especially Chapter 1 and 2, the repertoire method demonstrates its ability to
solve many sums and recurrences. However, I honestly admit that it is quite
difficult to apply and fully understand how it works. In this note, I try to
figure the way to effectively apply the method for solving recurrences.</p>

<h1 id="definition">Definition</h1>

<p>In essence, the main goal of the method is to find coefficients for a <strong>linear
combination</strong> of a set of recurrences. This method works very well on linear
recurrences, in the sense that the solutions can be expressed as a sum of
coefficients multiplied by functions of $n$ Therefore,
if we have to find a closed-form of a linear recurrence, this is worth trying.</p>

<p>The method is not described clearly in ConMath because the authors always come
up with a set of recurrences and get their coefficients but they do not
mention how they figure out. Regarding this aspect, Sedgewick&rsquo;s book obtains
accessible clarification and systematic examples. Therefore, I use the procedure
in Sedgewick&rsquo;s book as a recipe for the repertoire method:</p>

<ol>
<li>Relax the recurrence by adding an extra function term.</li>
<li>Substitue known functions into the recurrence to derive identities similar to the recurrence.</li>
<li>Take linear combination of such identities to derive an equation identical to the recurrence.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the first look, it is quite abstract. However, some examples carried out
in the book illustrate how we manipulate the steps. Suppose that we have
recurrence $a_{n} = a_{n-1} + {\text stuff} $. First we generalize the
identity by replacing ${\text stuff}$ with $f(n)$, i.e., $a_{n} = a_{n-1} + f(n)$.
We easily obtain $f(n) =  a_{n} - a_{n-1}$. The next step is to build a table
of ingredients in which we can construct $f(n)$. Finally, we determine coefficients
of each component so that they satisfy $f(n)$ and the basis of the
recurrence.</p>

<p>For more details and explanations, I strongly recommend reading
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1023510/397515">Markus Scheuer&rsquo;s answer</a>. Of
course, ConMath (Chapter 1, 2, 6) is a good material for practicing the method
except understanding purposes. Section 2.5 from Sedgewick&rsquo;s book summarizes
some approaches to finding the closed-form including the repertoire method.
Examples in the book are required reading.</p>

<p>The best way to fully understand the method is to work through examples.</p>

<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>

<h2 id="closed-form-of-sums">Closed-form of sums</h2>

<p>We can easily convert sum of a sequence into a linear recurrence. Let begin
with the first example which only contains term $n^3$.</p>

<p>$ S_{n} = \sum_{k=0}^n k^3$</p>

<p>This sum can be seen as:</p>

<p>$ a_{0} = 0$
$ a_{n} = a_{n-1} + n^3$</p>

<p>Next,  we build a table of $a_{n}$ and $a_n - a_{n-1}$.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>$a_n$</th>
<th>$a_n -a_{n-1}$</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>n</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$n^2$</td>
<td>$2n-1$</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$n^3$</td>
<td>$3n^2-3n+1$</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$n^4$</td>
<td>$4n^3-6n^2+4n-1$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>How can I fill $a_n$? Since we want $f(n)$ obtains $n^3$
and we observe that $f(n) = a_n - a_{n-1}$ depends on the degree of $n$ in
$a_n$ and hence we come up with some simple sequence, i.e., computing $a_n - a_{n-1}$.
Turn out $f(n)$ have smaller degree of $n$ than $a_n$ exactly 1. $f(n)$ obtaining $n^3$
means that $a_n$ has to obtain $n^4$. The simplest form we can come up with
is $n^3 = \alpha (4n^3-6n^2+4n-1)$. So $\alpha = {1\over 4}$, we need to eliminate $n^2$,
$n$ and constants. In the second attempt, we add $n^3$ and $n^2$ into the
linear combination:</p>

<p>$$
\alpha (4n^3-6n^2+4n-1) + \beta(3n^2-3n+1) + \lambda (2n-1) = n^3
$$</p>

<p>$$
\begin{cases}
-6\alpha + 3\beta = 0\newline
4\alpha -3\beta + 2\lambda = 0\newline
-\alpha + \beta - \lambda = 0
\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>The solution is $(\alpha, \beta,\lambda) =({1\over 4}, {1\over 2}, {1\over 4}) $
and hence $a_n = \alpha n^3 + \beta n^2 + \lambda n = {1\over 4}n^2(n+1)^2$.
Also, since $a_0 = 0$, it is the final solution.</p>

<p>Let try another example, this time we use an exercise in ConMath:</p>

<p>$$ S_{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{k} (-1)^kk^2$$</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>$a_n$</th>
<th>$a_n-a_{n-1}$</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$(-1)^nn^2$</td>
<td>$(-1)^n(2n^2-2n+1)$</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$(-1)^n $</td>
<td>$2(-1)^n$</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$(-1)^nn $</td>
<td>$(-1)^n(2n-1)$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The solution is $S_n = {1\over 2}(-1)^n n(n+1)$ since we just add the first term
and the last term together and then divide by 2, we get $f(n)$. When I first saw
the sum, I could not think any sequences which help me find $f(n)$. After
play which some sequences, I realize that assigning $a_n = f(n) = (-1)^nn^2$
actually lets other patterns be discovered.</p>

<h2 id="linear-recurrences">Linear Recurrences</h2>

<p>$ a_0 = 7 $</p>

<p>$ a_n = a_{n-1} + 2n^2 + 7 \; n &gt; 0 $</p>

<p>Based on the table we built in previous examples, we can construct a linear
combination for the recurrence:</p>

<p>$\alpha(3n^2-3n+1) + \beta(2n-1) + \lambda 1 = 2n^2+7$</p>

<p>$$
\begin{cases}
3\alpha = 2 \newline
-3\alpha + 2\beta = 0 \newline
\alpha - \beta + \lambda = 7
\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>The solution is $(\alpha, \beta, \lambda) = ({2\over 3}, 1, {22\over 3})$. However,
at this time $a_0= 0 \neq 7$, we have to add constant $7$ to the final form.
The closed-form is $a_n = {2\over 3}n^3+n^2+{22\over 3}n+7$.</p>
