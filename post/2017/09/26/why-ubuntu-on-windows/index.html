<p>For programming purposes, I prefer Linux to Windows. However, Windows is
really good at entertaining and office works. Beside, Microsoft Office is the
best office suit I ever have experienced, and OneNote is one of my favorite
note-taking software. Not to mention my beloved Bilizzard games such as Diablo,
Starcraft and other video games.</p>

<p>A solution to integrate Windows and Linux in one machine is
to install dual-boot. However, I am tired of switching between 2 OSs.
In addition, we have to configure the systems so that it can easily transfer
files between 2 different partition formats.</p>

<p>Another workaround is to run Windows or Linux on a virtual machine.
Since I usually play video games, I could not use Windows as a client.
Running Linux virtually seems promising. Unfortunately, my laptop is not strong
enough to run the virtual machine smoothly.</p>

<p>Finally, M$ comes up with a new feature in Windows 10 named
<a href="http://wsl-guide.org/en/latest/">&lsquo;Windows Subsystem for Linux&rsquo;</a>. Suprisingly,
it works flawlessly except several minor issues.</p>

<h1 id="settings">Settings</h1>

<ol>
<li>Turn Windows Subsystem On: find <code>Windows features</code> and
select <code>Windows Subsystem for Linux</code> , wait for the installation and
restart.</li>

<li><p>Open Windows Store and install Ubuntu.
I also saw OpenSuse on the store.
Hopefully, there will be more distros adapted in future,
especially Arch Linhx/Manjaro which is my favorite.</p></li>

<li><p>After working around with Ubuntu and Tmux in <code>cmder</code>, I have found out
that <a href="https://github.com/mintty/wsltty">wsltty</a> is the best tool to avoid
fonts broken, key arrow issues. Besides, it run faster
than <code>cmder</code> although <code>cmder</code> has many useful features.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the result:</p>

<p><img src="https://static.notion-static.com/67ecfe6abf0242199ffec19dd227a000/Untitled" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are several tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the cursor to block.</li>
<li>Turn off the mouse support feature in vim (<code>:set mouse=</code>) in order to copy
text from Windows to vim.</li>
<li>Copy from vim to Windows applications:

<ol>
<li>Install xsel/xclip on Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/">Xming</a></li>
<li>Set <code>export DISPLAY=:0</code> in the bashrc or zshrc</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="installing-archlinux-on-wsl">Installing ArchLinux on WSL</h1>

<p>After several months waiting a better solution, finally I found <a href="https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL">ArchWSL</a>
which is easy to install and full of configuration. In addition, it turns out
that <code>wsltty</code> is not a tool I really want since there are still some issues with
Unicode font and delay. Now I am using <code>xfce4-terminal</code> with the help from
Xming.</p>

<p>With a few steps we are able to run xfce4-terminal directly from Windows:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://tunecomp.net/add-program-to-startup-windows-10/">Set Xming to run on startup</a>.</li>

<li><p>Use following command in Run to execute <code>xfce4-terminal</code>:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden -Command &quot;iex \&quot;path\to\arch.exe run DISPLAY=:0 xfce4-terminal&quot;&quot;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="windows-defender">Windows Defender</h1>

<p>It is so annoying that I have to turn it off. Somehow, the program always scans
the Linux folder. Eventually, everything in Subsystem runs so slow. A better
workaround is to add the Linux folder to the excluding list of Windows Defender.</p>
